## Introduction
* ObsidianLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android based on [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher).
* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions).
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.
* Redesigned UI and new icons give it a modern, dark‑theme look inspired by the Obsidian block.
